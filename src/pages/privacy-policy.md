## Definitions

**"My Apps"** — Refers to mobile applications that are developed for the Android operating system and published on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store) by [Grabster Studios](https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=5292302577722645992).

## This Website

Browser cookies are used to remember whether you had dark mode enabled on this site since your last visit or not. Other than that, this is a static website. Meaning no other data is collected.

## My Apps That Do Not Collect Data

1. [Catalyst for KLWP](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=catalyst.grabsterstudios)
2. [Gradjent for KLWP](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=gradjent.grabsterstudios.pack)
3. [Gradjent Unlocked for KLWP](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=gradjentunlocked.grabsterstudios.pack)

5. [DashCards for KLWP](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dashcards.grabsterstudios)

These apps collect no personal data of any kind. These apps are for aesthetic purposes only and I have zero incentive to collect any sort of data from any user nor do these apps require any user data to function.

## My Apps that may collect data

1. [Reev Pro](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.reevpro.grabsterstudios)
2. [Reev Dark](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.reevdark.grabsterstudios)

These apps are also for aesthetic purposes. They do not require any user data to function. The only data that is collected is user email address and a list of apps installed on their device only on one specific condition as described below.

1. If a user explicitly uses the _Request icons_ feature within the app to `request` the _author_ for more icons to be added into the app in future updates. This data is sent directly to _author's_ request collection email which is then only used for the purposes of collecting app icons and their names for further icons development. User email addresses are dismissed after the request package that is included when the user sends the 'request' (.zip file containing app icons that are requested by the user, their launcher activity which is used for applying the correct icon to a specific app package and their names) is downloaded.
